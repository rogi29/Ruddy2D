# Ruddy2D

Ruddy2D is an ambitious project to build a full 2D Javascript Game Engine that would handle small projects like puzzle games and more complex projects like RPG games and even MMORPG type of games.

The Engine should feature a full 2D Physics engine, AI system, Interface Builder, Entity-component-system (ECS) architectural pattern, Multiplayer Server builder and more.

Bear in mind, Ruddy2D is an early stage of development and it is a long run project that might look impossible for many, yet we are determined to accomplish it in any case.
